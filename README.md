:smile:	Since I'm still learning -maybe- I overcomplecate my Javascript code, anyways I'm really really happy it turned out really well at the first try â™¥

I know I could have save a lot of code if I apply some CSS properties, but, as I say, I'm applying what I am learning on the road

I managed to apply a lot of the things I've been learning on Javascript so, ready for the next one :hugs:
